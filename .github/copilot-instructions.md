# CMT Leg Cast Design App - Copilot Instructions

This project is an Android application for medical leg measurement and 3D cast design specifically for CMT (Charcot-Marie-Tooth) patients.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Measure patient's leg using camera vision and ruler reference to design custom 3D printed orthotic casts
- **Target**: CMT patients needing ankle support and weight distribution assistance
- **Technology Stack**: Android, OpenCV, Camera2 API, 3D modeling, STL generation

## Key Features
1. Camera-based leg measurement using ruler as scale reference
2. Computer vision for accurate dimension extraction
3. 3D reconstruction from multiple 2D captures
4. Custom cast design with CMT-specific considerations
5. STL file generation for 3D printing
6. Medical safety validation and disclaimers

## Development Guidelines
- Focus on medical accuracy and safety
- Implement proper camera calibration
- Use OpenCV for image processing and measurements
- Consider ergonomic cast design for CMT symptoms
- Include proper medical disclaimers
- Ensure 3D printing compatibility
